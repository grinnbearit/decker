The deck features seven creatures with horsemanship, more than any of the other Portal Three Kingdoms preconstructed decks. Because they can't be blocked by creatures without horsemanship, these creatures will be the way you finish off your opponent. The second way Wu Kingdom gains control is through counterspells. This deck features six sorceries that can counter one of your opponent's spells. This deck also contains the Legend Creatures Lu Xun, Scholar General and Sun Quan, Lord of Wu."
