[#:card-list{:name "Kami Reborn"
             :description "The spirits of Kamigawa practice their own form of magic, and the 'Kami Reborn' deck puts it at your fingertips. Many of the creatures have 'spiritcraft' abilities that do something whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell. For example, Soilshaper turns a land into a 3/3 creature until end of turn and Thief of Hope steals 1 life from your opponent. Of course, all but a handful of your spells are Spirits or Arcane."

 #:card-list{:name "Way of the Warrior"
             :description "The 'Way of the Warrior' deck enlists a new brigade into your army: Samurai! These fearless warriors showcase the Champions of Kamigawa set's new combat ability: bushido. Whenever a creature with bushido 1 blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn. Some creatures have bushido 2, or even more. This evocative talent comes as standard for Samurai, and that makes them a force to be reckoned with. Since the bushido bonus is given on both offense and defense, your side should always have the upper hand in battle."
