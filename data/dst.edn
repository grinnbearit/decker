[#:card-list{:name "Master Blaster"
             :description "The point of the 'Master Blaster' deck is to blow things up. Well, that's not the whole point. It's also about cards that are really tough to deal with. In other words, the 'Master Blaster' deck tries to destroy as much as it can while making it as difficult as possible for opponents to slog through its powerful threats."

 #:card-list{:name "Mind Swarm"
             :description "The 'Mind Swarm' deck is fun to play because it has multiple paths to victory. At heart it's a black weenie deck that tries to quickly reduce your opponent's life total with aggressive flying creatures. It includes several excellent pieces of Equipment to enhance these creatures. But "Mind Swarm" also features a strong discard theme, and you can use these "hand destruction" cards to disrupt your opponents' game plans before they get going. Geth's Grimoire combines very well with these effects--every time you force opponents to discard a card, you get to draw a card. If you hit them with Wrench Mind, you may even be able to draw two cards!"

 #:card-list{:name "Transference"
             :description "What's the next best thing to creatures that can't be destroyed? How about creatures that pass along their power and toughness when they're destroyed? The 'Transference' deck explores the Darksteel set's modular ability. It runs plenty of Arcbound creatures, all of which have modular, plus there's a little blue for faster mana (that's right, blue for mana!) and some other zany tricks. Drop the Arcbound creatures, send them into battle, and you'll have an 11/11 flier in no time."
