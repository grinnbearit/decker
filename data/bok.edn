[#:card-list{:name "Dark Devotion"
             :description "The 'Dark Devotion' deck depends on powerful Demon Spirits, called oni, and the Ogres that worship them. The key to success with the deck is getting both Ogres and Demons into play at the same time. Their combined size and strength should be too much for your opponents to deal with."

Get your creatures past your opponents’ defenses early and often so that you can use the ninjutsu ability to maximum effect."

The quick creatures of the 'Rats' Nest' deck will gnaw away your opponents' life totals while its powerful discard and destruction spells tear apart any defenses. With eleven creatures that cost one or two mana, you're sure to get off to a fast start. If your opponent gets some blockers out, you have Horobi's Whisper and Befoul to blow them away and keep attacking. And just as your opponents are getting ready to play their most powerful, expensive spells, you can play Three Tragedies or use your Nezumi Bone-Reader to make them discard their hands and leave them with nothing. With no options and no hope, the opposition should quickly fall to your growing Rat horde."

With all these crazy abilities at your disposal, a properly timed Arcane spell can send your opponent's head—and creatures—spinning."
