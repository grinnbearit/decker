[#:card-list{:name "Burning Sky"
             :description "The \"Burning Sky\" deck's wide range of Efreets, Djinns, and Elementals let you scorch clear the battlefield or simply fly above any defenders. Funnel red mana into Wildfire Emissary and Pyric Salamander for maximum power. Sacrifice Flame Elemental to burn out a problematic creature on the other side of the table. Let Suq'Ata Firewalker deliver a precision 1-damage strike to any target, or have Subterranean Spirit zap everything (except itself) at once. Be careful, though—the Firewalker's ability won't protect it from Subterranean Spirit's blast."

Thanks to the deck's numerous copies of Rampant Growth and Quirion Elves, though, that might be as early as turn three. Then it's time to start building your flock."

 #:card-list{:name "Night Terrors"
             :description "At heart, the \"Night Terrors\" deck is a beatdown deck with some tricks up its sleeve. Your best course of action is to play out efficient attackers and, well, attack with them. The deck features two tremendously efficient flying creatures: Skulking Ghost is a 2-power creature with flying that costs only two mana, and Feral Shadow provides the same power and evasion for just one mana more. Neither creature is durable, but their goal is to damage your opponent in the early game—you'll have more devious tricks to pull later."
