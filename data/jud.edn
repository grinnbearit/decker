[#:card-list{:name "Air Razers"
             :description "The 'Air Razers' deck has a simple philosophy: Whatever it can't fly over, it burns out of the way. The deck comes equipped with fliers, fliers, and more fliers, plus a healthy amount of red direct damage. This deck wins quickly and viciously."

 #:card-list{:name "Inundation"
             :description "Cheap white creatures and more cheap white creatures have always been a winning combination, and the Inundation deck is no exception to the rule. You should play your creatures as quickly as possible and attack early and often. With this deck, you have to play aggressively. Attack when you can, defend when you must. You may lose a creature or two when you attack, but keep up the assault as long as you can deal damage to your opponent. The first to deal 20 damage wins, and this deck does that faster than most."

Thriss, Nantuko Primus can even give a buddy +5/+5 for a turn. Give a creature with trample a boost and stomp your opponent into a bloody pulp. Crush of Wurms can put three 6/6 Wurms into play - the most power and toughness ever produced at one time by a single card - twice! After a few behemoths get into play, it'll be time to show off your victory dance."
