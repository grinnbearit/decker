[#:card-list{:name "Rot from Within"
             :description "The \"Rot from Within\" deck combines features of aggressive decks and combo decks into a winning package. It can come out of nowhere, delivering a lethal ten poison counters to a hapless opponent before he or she even knows what's going on. Inexpensive creatures like Glistener Elf and Ichorclaw Myr can sneak in a point or two of damage early, then rise to enormity thanks to cards like Groundswell, Primal Bellow, and Mutagenic Growth."
