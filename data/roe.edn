[#:card-list{:name "Eldrazi Arisen"
             :description "The Eldrazi Arisen deck puts you in command of the Eldrazi, an ancient race of behemoths that has awoken and begun to terrorize the inhabitants of Zendikar. The stars of your deck are Ulamog's Crusher, Hand of Emrakul, and Pathrazer of Ulamog. Each of these Eldrazi creatures is 7/7 or larger, and all have the annihilator ability that forces an opponent to sacrifice a number of permanents every time you attack with them. Your goal is to cast them as quickly as possible and then ride them to victory."

             :description "The Levelers' Scorn deck puts you in control of the \"levelers\", creatures that become more powerful over time. Once suitably leveled up, Skywatcher Adept gains flying and Hada Spy Patrol becomes unblockable. Such evasive creatures are perfect for defeating a helpless opponent. With just two level counters, Echo Mage gains the ability to copy each instant or sorcery spell. Use defensive measures like Wall of Bone and Phantasmal Abomination to make sure you have time to level up your creatures to maximum potency."

Use your Auras with totem armor to protect your creatures and make them large enough to run over any opposition. Those Auras also work well with Kor Spiritdancer, who gets an additional +2/+2 for each Aura enchanting it."
