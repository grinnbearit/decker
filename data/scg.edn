[#:card-list{:name "Goblin Mob"
             :description "Welcome to the wonderful world of Goblins. This deck is definitely not about the long game-it's about playing creatures quickly and attacking with them. With over twenty creatures that cost three mana or less, you should be able to get out a horde of the little monsters before your opponent has much of a defense set up."

This time, you're hoping to wipe the grin off his face. But it's not looking good. Fred has three 6/6 Beasts in play, and he's been applying the beats to your face for a couple of turns now. He didn't leave any creatures back to block, but he doesn't care. He has 20 life, and you're toast after one more attack. What could you possibly do in one turn? All you have in play are eight mountains and a Goblin Machinist."

 #:card-list{:name "Storm Surge"
             :description "To win with the 'Storm Surge' deck, you need to get as much power as you can out of your ten storm cards. With all the cheap creatures and instants in the deck, you can play spells rapidly and then follow them up with a massive storm spell. But for that strategy to work, you must be patient and plan wisely. Always look ahead to see if you can set up a good situation. Don't play your one-mana instants at the first opportunity. Save them instead. Then when you leave yourself open to a big attack, surprise your opponent by playing one or two cheap spells followed by Wing Shards!"
