[#:card-list{:name "Critical Mass"
             :description "When playing with the Saviors of Kamigawa set, having more cards in hand than your opponent is more important than ever. Some decks try to get ahead with little tricks to draw a card here or there. The 'Critical Mass' deck takes a more direct approach: Just smash your opponent's hand to pieces. Ghost-Lit Stalker and Honden of Night's Reach pack powerful discard effects that will batter your opponent down to zero cards in no time. Meanwhile, 'sweeps' make sure that you're holding as many cards as you want. The combination of a full hand for you and an empty hand for your opponent makes for a quick and brutal victory."

The real cleverness begins when you start returning your own Spirits to your hand so you can play them again for more "spiritcraft" goodies!"
