[#:card-list{:name "Into the Breach"
             :description "\"The \"Into the Breach\" deck is all about two things: speed and synergy. On their own, cards like Ornithopter (a 0/2 flier) and Memnite (a 1/1 creature with no abilities) are not exactly going to end games quickly. Combined with powerful battle cry cards like Signal Pest and Goblin Wardriver, however, those unassuming zero-mana creatures can really pack a punch!"

 #:card-list{:name "Infect and Defile"
             :description "To win with the \"Infect and Defile\" deck, you'll need to be patient. Your deck is not designed to be aggressive, and if you simply cast your creatures and attack with them, you may find yourself quickly outmatched. Your deck has two primary advantages: first, a potent long-term planâ€”that is, given enough time, you'll draw more cards, have more creatures, and cast more spells. Second, you can effectively ignore your opponent's life total. Your deck is packed with creatures with infect. Every damage dealt to opponents from these creatures takes the form of poison counters, and a player with ten poison counters loses the game."

From there, summon up some Kuldotha Ringleaders, Accorder Paladins, or any other creature with the battle cry ability, and even the lowliest of your creatures will pack a heavy punch. Or call upon Victory's Herald and watch as your armies swarm over your opponents' minions from the skies."
