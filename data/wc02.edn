[#:card-list{:name "Psychatog - Carlos Romao, World Champion"
             :description "Rom√£o's blue-black 'Psychatog' deck was the defining deck of the tournament. A control deck at heart, with lots of card drawing and countermagic, it wants to stall an opponent until it can play a devastating Upheaval and Psychatog on the same turn. While many people at this year's World Championship played this style of deck, Carlos simply played his version better than everyone else played theirs."
