[#:card-list{:name "Code of the Orzhov"
             :description "The Orzhov know how to get what they want—they bleed it out of their victims. Slo-o-owly. While playing the Code of the Orzhov deck, you'll strip away all opposing threats while you gradually, relentlessly pick away at your opponent's life total. There's nothing more satisfying to members of the Orzhov than being in complete control of the suffering inflicted on their enemies."

The creatures in your deck are probably already bigger than the creatures your opponent has—but factor in the bloodthirst ability and your power-pumping enchantments and there's no contest! When your opponent starts crying for mercy, don't bother showing any. It's not the Gruul way."

This deck is jam-packed with instant and sorcery spells, many of which can copy themselves thanks to replicate. Nearly all the creatures in the deck reward you when you play instants and sorceries as well! The replicated copies won't trigger your creatures' abilities, but who cares? You're getting tons of extra spells! It all adds up to an avalanche of magical craziness that'll bury your opponent."
