[#:card-list{:name "Deadspread"
             :description "With the \"Deadspread\" deck, you'll reap a lot of rewards for a little bit of work. Your aim is to control your opponent's creatures by giving them -1/-1 counters. Then you'll proliferate, a new ability that allows you to add counters to permanents and players that have them. A single -1/-1 counter will soon become a real nightmare for careless opponents as you use Fume Spitter and proliferate to spread death. Or use the 6/6 Carnifex Demon to spread counters while flying in for some massive damage."
