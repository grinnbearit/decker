          "1 player | 1 pack | 5 minutes\nOBJECTIVE:\nSurvive the night by defeating the monster in your booster!\nGET READY:\nOpen a booster and pick a double-faced card (DFC), then set it aside. This is the monster you will face. Discard all ad, token, and art cards. Shuffle the remaining cards into a stack and place it face down to create your library.\nLET'S PLAY:\nPlay a game of Magic against the monster with the following rule modifications:\n• You start with zero cards in hand and 20 life.\n• At the beginning of your upkeep, create a Treasure token. (It's an artifact with \"{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.\")\nThe monster doesn't have a life total, mana, or library, and it can only be defeated by removing it from the battlefield twice: once on its front side and once on its transformed side."}

          "The monster behaves automatically as follows:\n• It starts the game on the battlefield on its front side.\n• It does't attack until it has taken a number of turns equal to its mana value.\n• It attacks you on each of its turns after it's able to attack.\n• The first time it leaves the battlefield for any reason, return it to the battlefield transformed. It can't transform by any other means. (It now attacks during each of its turns regardless of if it could attack before it transformed.)\n• If it leaves the battlefield for any reason while transformed, it is defeated.\nTake turns with the monster, performing its actions for it.\nThough you cannot attack the monster, you can block with your creatures when it attacks, and you can target it with spells that target any creature or a creature your opponent controls.\nYou lose if your life total reaches 0 or if you attempt to draw a card from an empty library.\nTO WIN:\nDefeat the transformed monster to win."}]}

Then each player randomly selects a nonland, non-colorless _Magic_ card from their own cards without revealing it to the rest of the players.

Players may draw the top card of the deck *OR* pick up *any* card from the discard pile. If a card is taken from the discard pile, they must *take every card discarded on top of that card* as well.
