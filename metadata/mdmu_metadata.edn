Connect all cards in the *most condensed way possible.*\nGET READY:\nOpen a pack, remove all basic lands, ads, and tokens.\nLET'S PLAY:\nPlace a card face up to start the game. That card is now in play. Continue to place cards that connect to another card in play (see diagram on the back of this card).\nTO WIN:\nThe game ends when all cards that can be connected have been placed. Determine how many cards long and wide the board is, then add whichever number is higher to the number of unplaced cards to get your rank. 5 or lower is Planeswalker (the best!), 6 is Wizard, and 7+ is Goblin!"}

Then they add three of each basic land (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest) to their ppack and shuffle. This becomes the player's deck.\nLET'S PLAY:\nRandomly determine who goes first, then play a game of Magic! There are many variants of Mini-Master.
