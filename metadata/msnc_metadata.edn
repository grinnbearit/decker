Players make their piles with the goal of winning a series of Magic games with these modified rules:\nPlayers start at 5 life, have infinite mana, and cannot lose by drawing from an empty library.\nLET'S PLAY:\nRandomly determine who goes first. Each player chooses which pile their opponent will use for each round. Then both players draw all three of their cards and play a game of Magic. When a player loses a game, they get to go first in the next game.\nTO WIN:\nThe first player to win two games wins the match."}

But keep in mindâ€”the most valuable trinkets go directly into the mob boss's pockets.\nGET READY: First, each player declares allegiance to a crime family. The families are: The Obscura, The Maestros, The Riveteers, The Cabaretti, and The Brokers. (You can pick the same family as another player.)\nEach player opens a booster, sets aside all cards without Magic card backs, then shuffles the remaining cards to form their face-down deck.\nLET'S PLAY:\nEach round, players draw until they have four cards. Players then place two cards from their hand face down in front of them as profit. When finished, all players simultaneously reveal their profit cards and"}
