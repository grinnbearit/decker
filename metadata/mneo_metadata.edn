First, the Secretkeeper opens a pack and removes any lands and cards without Magic card backs. Next, they shuffle the remaining cards and pick one at random. That card is the mystery card. Finally, the Secretkeeper gives the Detective the rest of the cards, and the game begins.\nLET'S PLAY:\nThe Detective must correctly guess four facts"}

To do this, they choose and reveal cards one at a time.\nWhen each card is revealed, the Secretkeeper tells the Detective how many of the four facts that card and the mystery card have in common. Then the Detective may either guess the four facts or reveal another card to get more clues.\nThe Detective gets only one guess, and they must guess all four facts correctly to win. Once the Detective has guessed, the round ends and the players switch roles with a new pack.\nTO WIN:\nDiscover all four facts using as few cards as possible. The Detective who guesses correctly using the fewest clue cards wins! If neither player guessed correctly, or if there is a tie, play another round!"}]}
